You can create new roles in your organisation by using **New Role** card :two:.

You can view all roles and existing role hierarchy in you organisation on **Organisation Role Hierarchy** card :three:.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:**

* Hierarchy in an organisation is defined by `Security Level` assigned to Role. Lower the Security Level value, higher that role will be in organization.
* ADMIN will always have highest role (i.e. Security Level = 0) in organization.
* You can create multiple roles with same security levels in your organization
{% endhint %}



### Create New Role

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:**

Creating Role in Organization is one way process. Once you created the Role, you cannot delete it.&#x20;

Please clarify your organisation structure before implementing it in system.
{% endhint %}

* You can create new Role by adding new role name in Title input box on New Role card.
* Next, enter the appropriate desired value for security level. This value will be numbers with 0 being the lowest security level (i.e. Highest Role in Organisation).
* Once all values are in place, click **Send.** Hence new role will get added in system and you can assign this role to users going forward.
